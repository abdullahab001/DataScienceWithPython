Data Types

                type(4) # 4 is an integer

                int

                type(3.2) # 3.2 is float

                float

                type('123') #values within quotes are string

                str

                type(True) #boolean value

                bool

                type(None)

                NoneType

Variables

               a = 5        #value 5 is stored in variable a

               b = 3.5     #value 3.5 is stored in variable b

               c ='123'    # 123 is a string as it is enclosed within quotes and stored in variable c

               d = True   #boolean value True is stored in variable d

               e = None  #No Values in e

print(f’Type of {a} is {type(a)}\nType of {b} is {type(b)} \nType of {c} is {type(c)} \nType of {d} is {type(d)} \nType of {e} is {type(e)}’)




Output:

Type of 5 is <class 'int’>

Type of 3.5 is <class 'float’>

Type of 123 is <class 'str’>

Type of True is <class 'bool’>

Type of None is <class 'NoneType'>
